  <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! This place is a hub for info about me, my past projects, & varyingly interesting knick-knacks. Enjoy your stay \o/</p>

  <h2>who am i?</h2>
  <p>I'm a second-year student at Rice University studying computer science and two of {data science, statistics, science & technology studies}. I'm primarily interested in AI/ML, with a budding interest in cryptography & randomized algorithms. In my free time, you can catch me playing rogue-likes, reading manga, and writing about all kinds of thoughts and feelings.</p>
  <p>What's currently on my mind:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸŽ® The Binding of Isaac: Repentance</li>
    <li>ðŸŽ´ Trigun</li>
    <li>ðŸŽ² Critical Role (Campaign 3)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>experience</h2>
  <p>[2024] It's a secret... for now.</p>

  <p>[2023] <b>Research Intern Ã— Rice University Department of Physics and Astronomy</b>: Worked with Prof. Aaron Higuera as part of the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment. Simulated atmospheric neutrino collisions with Shell scripts & designed a convolutional neural network in Tensorflow/Keras to predict the energy involved. Presented findings at Rice's Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium 2023.

  <h2>projects</h2>

  <p><b>The Gambit of Ord</b>: A command-line implementation of a chance-based game featured in the podcast "Critical Role." Runs on C. [Work-in-Progress]

  <p><b>Cassava Leaf Diagnosis</b>: A Bayesian convolutional neural network for identifying disease in cassava leaves while capturing uncertainty in classification. Runs on Tensorflow / Keras. [Work-in-Progress]

  <p><b>Feedback and Evaluation via Automated Testing</b>: A tool that generates black-box test cases for Python programs. Uses a greedy algorithm based on Set Cover that optimizes program performance. Runs on Java.</p>

  <p><a href="https://devpost.com/software/banter"><b>Banter</b></a>: HackRice 13 submission. A demo for a web app that allows users to navigate audiobooks using voice commands. Runs on React / TypeScript / Tornado.</p>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/lixhuynh/boil-the-froppy"><b>Boil the Froppy</b></a>: An early project I created to learn web design, inspired by the playlist generator "Boil the Frog." Assesses relatedness of anime through frequency of MyAnimeList recommendations, using the Jikan REST API. Runs on React / TypeScript / Node.JS.</p>

  <p><a href="https://atwork.dunescience.org/publications/"><b>DUNE Publications Hub</b></a>: A page I created as a boon during my research internship. Automatically populates with and organizes papers and journals published by the DUNE collaboration, using the INSPIRE-HEP REST API. Runs on custom HTML / Python.</p>
